          Hi there, we are very, very flattered that you are thinking about
          supporting us and the devlopment of this small app!
        </p>
        <p>
          Before you continue we would like to get a chance of introducing us to
          you though. You should know who your tip goes to:
        </p>
        <p>
          We are Niels and Marius, both {new Date().getFullYear() - 2002} years
          old students from the north of Germany. We initially developed
          slidecontrol as a side project for high school but decided to continue
          working on it afterwards when we realized that we filled a gap. But
          how much does it cost us?
        </p>
        <p>
          Keeping slidecontrol running costs us exactly 8€ (and some of our free
          time of course) a month for our server which we happily pay on our
          own. However since we don't like the idea of ads and other
          privacy-nightmares like Analytics we draw this motivation from you
          (bills don't pay themselves unfortunately).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a student like us or just going through tough times you do
          not have to pay anything of course, giving us an honest review on the{" "}
